-----Vilka avvikelser från MVC-idealet kan ni identifiera i det ursprungliga användargränssnittet?-----

CarView was tightly coupled with CarController violating SoC. 
- with MVC in mind the View module should only display things and notify the Controller module if the user does anything

CarController handled both simulation logic and Ui interactions. the Controller should only process user input while the model handles the sim. logic.

DrawPanel was rendering Cars and handeling their position. However the model should only handle the logic while the view displays the cars.



-----Vilka av dessa brister åtgärdade ni med er nya design från del 3?-----

we separated simulation loic from the Ui as SimulationController now handles sim. logic while CarController handles what should happen to the cars when the button is pressed

CarView and CarController are no longer tightly connected as EventView now handles button actions and informs CarController which button is pressed

DrawPanel now only renders the images while SimulationController manages the positions and states
